# MadLibs
A simple implementation of the MadLibs word game built using Python.

User can choose to play and input each replacement word, or allow the computer to randomly select words to complete the story.

The stories and placeholders are stored in text files.
Random word choices must be supplied for each placeholder type for the computer to successfully play the game.
  i.e. if a placeholder calls for a 'Celebrity Name', a corresponding textfile 'celebrity_names.txt' needs to exist
  and be populated.
