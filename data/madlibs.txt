I dwell in a ## house I know That ## many a summer ago, And left no ## but the cellar walls, And a cellar in which the daylight falls And the purple-stemmed wild raspberries grow. O'er ruined fences the grape-vines shield The woods come back to the ## field; The ## tree has grown one copse Of new wood and old where the ## chops; The footpath down to the well is healed. I dwell with a strangely aching ## In that vanished abode there far apart On that ## and forgotten road That as no ## now for the toad. Night comes; the black bats ## and dart; The ## is coming to shout And hush and ## and flutter about: I hear him begin far enough away Full many a time to say his say Before he arrives to say it out. It is under the small, ##, summer star. I know not who these mute folk are Who share the ## place with me— Those stones out under the low-limbed tree Doubtless bear names that the mosses mar. They are ## folk, but slow and sad— Though two, close-keeping, are lass and ad,— With none among them that ever ##, And yet, in view of how many things, As sweet ## as might be had.
